			<h3>Provenance Pre-owned</h3>
			<p>motor cars are designed and crafted to live a long and rich life. Their story begins the moment they are driven away by their first owners, from our home in Goodwood. Provenance is a collection of the finest previously-owned 
			</p>
			<p>We ensure they have been meticulously cared for and still meet our uncompromising standards. Only then do we prepare them to meet their new owners – when the next chapter of their story begins and their journey continues.</p>

				<p>Our legendary and unrivalled attention to detail is no different for a previously-owned Rolls Royce, than it is for the motor cars leaving Goodwood today. It begins with the selection of the Provenance motor car itself. We only feature those that have been meticulously cared for and maintained at the highest level, with an exhaustive written record to prove it.</p>
				<p>No one knows a Roll Royce motor car like the craftspeople and artisans who built it. So only specialist technicians, who we train to our unparalleled standards, are qualified to exhaustively inspect and approve all Provenance motor cars – from the paintwork and interior to the mechanics and technology. Any repairs or refurbishment needed are carried out to our exacting requirements, using Roll Royce Genuine Parts. And we thoroughly check the motor car’s history and mileage, to ensure its integrity. </p>
				<p> Finally, before we award the Provenance title, we carry out an extensive road test. So, as its new owner, you will experience a Rolls Royce that drives as beautifully as it did the day it left Goodwood.</p>

				<p>Each Rolls Royce is unique. And Provenance Pre-Owned gives you the opportunity to add to its individuality and legacy. As its new owner, you drive your Roll Royce away the moment you purchase it, rather than patiently waiting for it to be hand-built. However, you are still able to make your motor car individual to you by selecting from a breadth of Bespoke features, which can be crafted once you take ownership. Inside, you can personalise your headrests with any emblem or initials you choose, add the bewitching Starlight Headliner or fit a humidor into the glove box. While on the exterior, you can choose a brushed steel bonnet, fully polished alloy wheels, or even a 24-carat gold Spirit of Ecstasy.</p>
				<p>
				You also receive a minimum of two years’ servicing and warranty, and two years’ roadside assistance. If you are ready to become a Roll Royce owner, your dealer will be able to help you find your perfect motor car. Or you can search our Provenance Pre-Owned collection online. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, we can notify you the moment your preferred Rolls Royce become available </p>
